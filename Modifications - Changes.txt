Changes for Next Revision
 Polarity protection at input
 Optional position for resistor divider at digital output (to allow 3.3V logic with 5V power source) - better than adjusting gain
 Can commonise the two trimpot values?
 Gain trimpot is either 100k-150k for conductive mode or 500k+ for capacitive mode - better solution? 
 More capacitive coupling (closer spacing?)
 Modifications as noted below
 
 
Changes from the original Rev A sch (29/06/2024) to the revised Rev A (29/09/2024):
 R10 change to XXk to increase hysteresis 
 R9 change to 10k to reduce power LED brightness. This better matches the orange LED too
 Cut track near R7 to isolate panel sense net and insert 1nF between panel sense and R7, add 100pF parallel to R7 -- filtering for 50Hz and reducing impact of capacitive coupling to improve dynamic range
 C4 = 100nF
 RV2 change to Rgain=100k since this is decent for both resistive and capacitive modes
 Add location of the anaOut scaling mod (optional)
 Change RV1 to 100k since value is not important and 100k is better for the anaout scaling mod if desired
 
**** DEVELOPMENT NOTES ****

Remark: open circuit panel is about 60pF//20Meg+
Tape + foil on about 1/3 coverage increases capacitance to 94pF, so not a very big change

Still can't get a really good capacitve sensing result. Suggest increasing drive frequency to make it easier to couple and filter 

origi osc freq, cap sense, half covered
 790mV -> 910mV
 
Increase freq by reducing C2 to 10nF
 250mV -> 330mV
 
No good, so C2 back to 100nF. Change R8 to 10k (was mod=33k) to increase gain
 1.9V-> 2.75V
 2.7-3.9 = 1.2
 2.8-4.0 = 1.2
 3.15-4.3 = 1.15
 
Increasing C4 improves distinction between on/off states
C4=100nF/200nF sense now 1.5V delta or even higher, so not too bad

Still need gain to adjust for capsense and ressense modes, probably too much variaiton for a solder jumper

HPF 10k/100pF doesnt have any real need but it should give a more robust design in the next rev

with Rmod1 Cmod2 filter = 2.93V
without filter = 2.80V
Different boards so probably not really much difference


For resistive, quarter turn of 500k is plenty = 125k, probably 100k is fine
For capacitive, also 100k

resistive no drops = 2.1V, one drop = max 4.4V
capacitive one drop = 2.3, two drops = 2.5, 3 drops = 2.8, 8 drops = 4.0. Smear large drop = 4.4V max

Anaout ripple (open sensor) = 41mVpp with 100k in place of trimmer. Add extra 100k to GND = 84mV
Add 100nF to gnd after a 100k trimmer = 0V ripple so long as the pots not in the full max position

Replace D1 with 1k and change R5 to 10k, achieves a similar voltage (0.45V) at Vin=5V, but now scales down with supply voltage.
At 3.3Vin (all values are before anaout scaling)
  open cct = 0.37. Short cct = 2.69V
  1 drop on sensor = 1.9V, 3 drops = 2.45V
capacitive mode
  1 drop = 0.45V, 3 drops = 0.63, many drops = 0.75
  
5V
open 0.75V
short 4.4V
1 drop capacitive 0.9V
3 drops capacitive 1.07V

Increase teh gain, capacitive mode.
open cct = 1.42V, many drops = 2.00

Almost max gain 
open 2.03V, many drops = 3.0V
in resistive mode 1 drop = full 4.4V output

Ok so dont change the diode, change the gain. Dont want to waste our 600mV max on the sensor.
Retain RV2=100k, but add option for parallel 100k to make gain 50k for 3.3V operation, this gives us the margin we need again without compromising on sensor votlage. Retest:

3.3Vin with RV2=50k
open = 1.20V
change RV2=100k, 3.3Vin open/short = 1.81V/3.29, 5Vin = 1.85V/4.41V

Unity buffer is saturating when the comparator turns on. somethings not right there
> Disconnected R11, its still bad, depends on Vin. Something else going on...
Reason is the LMV324 common mode input range only extends down to 0V, not up to VCC. In fact the maximum for 5V is 4.2V typ which is about what we see fortunately. It gets more noticable at 3.3V where the limit appears to be more like 2.8V. This might be the reason for the odd behaviour of the comparator mode too. 
Solution is to make sure to divide the anaout signal before the unity buffer, and make sure the desired anaout range is lower than the supplied VCC.
To avoid this issue for the test results below, the anaout was scaled down 

VCC 3.3V, gain=50k, 
short = 2.00V
open = 0.95V =48%
capacitive 1 drop = 1.07=54%, 2 drops = 1.22=61%, 3 drops = 1.3=65%, big smear = 1.8
5V smear = 2.00, open = 0.98


VCC 3.3V, gain=100k,
short = 2.06V
open = 1.44V=72%
capacitive 1 drop = 1.62=81%, 2 drops = 1.75=88%, 3 drops = 1.81, big smear = 1.96
5V smear = 2.84, open = 1.54
