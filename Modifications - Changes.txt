Changes for Next Revision
 Polarity protection at input
 Optional position for resistor divider at digital output (to allow 3.3V logic with 5V power source) - better than adjusting gain
 Can commonise the two trimpot values?
 Gain trimpot is either 100k-150k for conductive mode or 500k+ for capacitive mode - better solution? 
 More capacitive coupling (closer spacing?)
 Modifications as noted below
 
 
Changes from the original Rev A sch (29/06/2024) to the revised Rev A (29/09/2024):
 R10 change to XXk to increase hysteresis 
 R9 change to 10k to reduce power LED brightness. This better matches the orange LED too
 Cut track near R7 to isolate panel sense net and insert 1nF between panel sense and R7, add 100pF parallel to R7 -- filtering for 50Hz and reducing impact of capacitive coupling to improve dynamic range
 C4 = 100nF

**** DEVELOPMENT NOTES ****

Remark: open circuit panel is about 60pF//20Meg+
Tape + foil on about 1/3 coverage increases capacitance to 94pF, so not a very big change

Still can't get a really good capacitve sensing result. Suggest increasing drive frequency to make it easier to couple and filter 

origi osc freq, cap sense, half covered
 790mV -> 910mV
 
Increase freq by reducing C2 to 10nF
 250mV -> 330mV
 
No good, so C2 back to 100nF. Change R8 to 10k (was mod=33k) to increase gain
 1.9V-> 2.75V
 2.7-3.9 = 1.2
 2.8-4.0 = 1.2
 3.15-4.3 = 1.15
 
Increasing C4 improves distinction between on/off states
C4=100nF/200nF sense now 1.5V delta or even higher, so not too bad

Still need gain to adjust for capsense and ressense modes, probably too much variaiton for a solder jumper

HPF 10k/100pF doesnt have any real need but it should give a more robust design in the next rev
